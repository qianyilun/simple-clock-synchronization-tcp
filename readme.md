# Java Socket Programming with TCP

## Introduction 
TCP socket is a communication mechanism via stream. A client program can create a TCP socket to connect to the socket of a server.

When the connection is made, the server creates a socket object on its end of the communication. The client and the server can now communicate by writing to and reading an object (or stream) from the socket.

The `java.net.Socket` class represents a socket, and the `java.net.ServerSocket` class provides a mechanism for the server program to listen for clients and establish connections with them.

TCP is a two-way communication protocol. Data can be sent across both streams at the same time.

### Steps

1. The server instantiates a `ServerSocket` object, denoting which `port number` communication is to occur on
2. The server invokes the `accept()` method of the `ServerSocket` class. This method waits until a client connects to the server on the given port
3. After the server is waiting, a client instantiates a `Socket` object, specifying the server name and the `port number` to connect to

#### Server

Serverâ€™s time is what we get from the system time

#### Client

Time from server is not the same as the local machine's time. It means clock is synced successfully.
